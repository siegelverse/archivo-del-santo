  ## Live Site
  
  
  [www.archivo-del-santo.com](www.archivo-del-santo.com)
  
  
  
  ## Future Updates
  
  ### Comments/Reviews
  
  Right now you can securely create and login into your account, 
but in the near future you will be able to leave reviews and comments on all the films.
  
  ### Movies
  
  There are currently only four movies you can watch at the moment. The movies are hosted on YouTube right now for legal reasons. I'm looking into adding more films to the archive soon, as well as looking into the legal ramifications of hosting them on the site itself.

### Emails

If you create an account you're automatically enrolled to our email list. I hope to have some emails sent out soon with further updates to the archive.
